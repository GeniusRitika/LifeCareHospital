            <h1><b>ABOUT LifeCare</b></h1>
            <p>LifeCare Hospital is as old as India herself.
                Ever since its inception, LifeCare Hospital have nursed a dream of becoming one of the leading healthcare provider of free India by providing global standards with advanced technology.
                In 1947, we began as a tertiary care unit. And today, we've grown much larger to become a multispecialty hospital.
                Over the years, our global quality of treatment has enabled us to become the hospital of trust for patients not only of Kolkata and eastern India, but also of neighboring countries.
                In our 70+ year long journey, we have touched millions of lives and with that, also the dream we nursed. LifeCares is part of the large and diversified business conglomerate RP-SG group.</p>

            <p>
                <ul style="font-size:18px;">
                    <li>Sometime in the early forties, British Companies realised the need of good healthcare services for their families.</li>
                    <li>Accordingly they opened a company called “East India Clinic Ltd” on 23rd October 1946</li>
                    <li>East India Clinic started 2 nursing homes in Elgin Road in 1947 and started his journey.</li>
                    <li>The construction of LifeCares Nursing Home started in 1958 and was inaugurated on 8th January 1961 by the then Chief Minister and eminent Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy whose birthday is celebrated as Doctor’s Day.</li>
                    <li>East India Clinic Ltd was shifted to LifeCares Nursing Home. The name LifeCares was derived from the name of the Palace.</li>
                    <li>The set up of Elgin Road as well as the pharmacy in Russel Street were closed immediately after the opening of the LifeCares Nursing Home.</li>
                    <li>The name of East India Clinic Limited got changed to LifeCares Hospital and Medical Research Centre Limited in the year 1994 and thereafter to LifeCares Medical Centre Limited in the year 2004.</li>
